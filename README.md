# horiseon-webpage

## Description
    - The motivation for this project was to help practice skills that we have been learning dealing with HTML code and CSS formatting.
    - The main point of this project was to take a look at code that was already there and cleaning it up a bit. This was done by assigning semantic HTML elements to the file
    instead of just using <div>. ALT attributes were used to also describe images that were found throughout the webpage. Certain elements of the HTML file were also assigned class and ID attributes so that the CSS code could be condensed.

## Installation
    Installion for this is not required. The index.html can just be brought up and viewed as a website

## Credit
    Code was provided and found on Gitlab provided by the coding bootcamp.
